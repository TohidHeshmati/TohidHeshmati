### Hi there, I'm Tohid 👋

I build high-performance CLI tools and secure backend services, focusing on bridging terminal productivity with cloud-native architecture.

### 🚀 Featured Projects
#### 🔗 [tiny-url-service](https://github.com/TohidHeshmati/tiny-url-service)
**Production-Ready URL Shortener** 
A high-concurrency service focused on distributed systems challenges like ID pre-allocation and shuffled security.
- **Scalability:** Range-based ID generation (DB segments) to minimize Redis network overhead.
- **Security:** LCG-shuffled IDs to prevent sequential scraping and protect business intelligence.
- **DevOps:** Full Dockerization, Makefile automation, and Flyway-managed schema migrations.

#### 🧠 [howdo](https://github.com/TohidHeshmati/howdo)
**Context-Aware Command Runner for Zsh.** 
**Forgetting commands? Never again** 😎  
An interactive "Second Brain" for the terminal that turns cheat sheets into dynamic commands with fuzzy-search, placeholder injection, and dry-run protection.

#### 🔐 [secretstash](https://github.com/TohidHeshmati/secretstash)
**Secure Note-Taking API.** A production-ready vault for personal data with JWT-based auth, rate-limiting, PostgreSQL persistence, and Redis-backed caching.

#### 🔗 [urlShortener](https://github.com/TohidHeshmati/urlShortener)
**High-Concurrency Backend Service** 
A scalable URL shortening service leveraging Redis for global ID generation.

#### 🛰️ Pulse OS (In Progress)
**Unified System Dashboard.** A modular command center for unifying hardware vitals, habits, and productivity metrics across macOS and Raspberry Pi.
